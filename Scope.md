Rails Project Deliverables
You have one week to put your Rails knowledge to the test! You'll need to create a Rails app from scratch so you can practice ActiveRecord associations, RESTful routing, and working with ActionView helpers.

Your apps should be done by this Friday. When you have an idea for a project, please tell the instructors your user stories and domain model.

You should aim to follow this schedule:

Monday/Tuesday: project approval, create models and associations, generate seed data
Wednesday/Thursday: set up routes/controllers/views, work on CRUD actions
Friday: add validations, work on any bonus deliverables
Your projects should meet the following deliverables:

[M]odels
Minimum 3 models with associations
Full CRUD
Validations
BONUS Add helper methods to your models to more easily extract information
[V]iews
Work on form_for and collection_select

BONUS Use the application.html.erb file to customize your site layout
[C]ontrollers / Routing
Only create the resources you need (using only or except)
Create at least one custom route
Follow RESTful conventions
BONUS Use before_action in your controllers to cut down on repetitive code
