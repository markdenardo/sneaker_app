Rails Project Deliverables
You have one week to put your Rails knowledge to the test! You'll need to create a Rails app from scratch so you can practice ActiveRecord associations, RESTful routing, and working with ActionView helpers.

Your apps should be done by this Friday. When you have an idea for a project, please tell the instructors your user stories and domain model.

You should aim to follow this schedule:

<!-- Monday/Tuesday: project approval, create models and associations, generate seed data -->
<!-- Wednesday/Thursday: set up routes/controllers/views, work on CRUD actions -->
<!-- Friday: add validations, work on any bonus deliverables -->
Your projects should meet the following deliverables:

[M]odels
<!-- Minimum 3 models with associations -->
<!-- Full CRUD -->
<!-- Validations -->
<!-- BONUS Add helper methods to your models to more easily extract information -->

[V]iews
<!-- Work on form_for and collection_select -->
<!-- Use other ActionView helpers like link_to and button_to -->
BONUS Use the application.html.erb file to customize your site layout

[C]ontrollers / Routing
<!-- Only create the resources you need (using only or except) -->
<!-- Create at least one custom route -->
<!-- Follow RESTful conventions -->
BONUS Use before_action in your controllers to cut down on repetitive code
